# Object Detection Repository

This repository contains implementations of various object detection algorithms. Object detection refers to the task of detecting and localizing objects within an image or video. In this repository, we explore the following popular object detection architectures:

- **RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks)**
- **YOLO (You Only Look Once)**
- **SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)**
- **Feature Pyramid Networks (FPN)**
- **RetinaNet (Focal Loss for Dense Object Detection)**

These models are widely used for solving real-world problems such as image classification, object tracking, autonomous driving, and more.

## RCNN (Region-based Convolutional Neural Networks)

RCNN was one of the pioneering models in the field of object detection. It involves:
1. **Region Proposal Networks (RPNs)**: Generating regions in an image that might contain an object.
2. **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Used for feature extraction.
3. **Region of Interest (ROI) Pooling**: Helps to convert the variable-sized regions into fixed-size feature maps.

### Key Features:
- RCNN achieves high accuracy by using selective search for region proposals and then applying CNNs for feature extraction.
- However, it is computationally expensive due to its multi-stage pipeline.

## YOLO (You Only Look Once)

YOLO is a real-time object detection model that frames the problem as a regression task. The model divides an image into a grid, where each grid cell predicts the class of objects and their bounding box coordinates.

### Key Features:
- **End-to-End Training**: Unlike RCNN, YOLO trains the entire pipeline in a single pass, making it faster for real-time applications.
- **Single Network**: YOLO performs object detection in a single pass, eliminating the need for separate region proposal steps.
- **Speed**: YOLO is designed to be extremely fast and can be used in real-time object detection tasks.

## SSD (Single Shot Multibox Detector)

SSD is a fast and efficient object detection method that performs predictions at multiple feature map scales. It provides a good trade-off between speed and accuracy.

### Key Features:
- **Single-shot Detection**: SSD detects objects in one pass of the network.
- **Multi-scale Predictions**: SSD uses feature maps at different resolutions to detect objects at various scales.
- **Real-time Performance**: SSD is known for its speed and can be used in real-time applications.
